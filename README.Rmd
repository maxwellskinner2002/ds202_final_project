## Our Dataset

[link](https://data.iowa.gov/Correctional-System/Current-Iowa-Correctional-System-Prison-Population/xbcv-c6t2/data)

This is a dataset of the Iowa State Correctional facility's population and contains the following variables :

```{r}
prison <- read_html("https://data.iowa.gov/Correctional-System/Current-Iowa-Correctional-System-Prison-Population/xbcv-c6t2/data")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
